# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
Data analysis of Amazon sales to uncover trends, top products, and business insights using Python.

📌 Overview

This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and profitability. The analysis is done using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) with a focus on business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.

📂 Dataset

🔹Contains transactional sales data from Amazon (orders, categories, sales, profit, region, etc.)

🔹Includes information such as order date, product category, sales, profit, quantity, and region.

🔹Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

🔑 Objectives

🔹Identify top-selling products and categories.

🔹Analyze revenue and profit trends over time.

🔹Detect seasonal sales patterns and regional variations.

🔹Explore customer purchasing behavior through data segmentation.

🛠️ Steps Performed

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

🔹Removed duplicates and missing values.

🔹Standardized column formats (dates, numeric values).

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  🔹Sales & profit distribution across categories.
  
  🔹Regional sales analysis with visualizations.
  
  🔹Time-series analysis for seasonal trends.
  
3.Visualization

  🔹Created charts (bar, line, heatmaps) using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
  
  🔹Highlighted key business insights with plots.

📈 Results & Insights

🔹Identified the most profitable product categories and least performing ones.

🔹Observed regional differences in sales performance.

🔹Found strong seasonal trends impacting customer purchases.

🔹Provided actionable insights to optimize sales strategy.

🚀 Future Work

🔹Develop an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau / Plotly Dash).

🔹Incorporate customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies.

💻 Technologies Used

🔹Python (Pandas, NumPy)

🔹Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
